Information on how to use auto-encoders on the MNIST dataset

# Overview
The code samples and short explanations helps a user to understand how to use an autoencoder for various explanations. Autoencoders have gained a lot of popularity in the field of image processing and computer vision in recent years. They are specially used for reconstruction of images and segmentation problems.

# General info about autoencoders
Motivating from neural network, the architecture of autoencoders resembles that of the previous. Autoencoders generally have a 'encoder' unit which is similar to the hidden layer of a neural network with some weights, and a 'decoder' unit where the weights of decoder unit are in such a way that the dimensions / pixels of input image/images are recovered.
